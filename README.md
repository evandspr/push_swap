# push_swap

A sorting algorithm project from the 42 curriculum.

## Concept
- Sort a stack of integers using two stacks (A and B) and a limited set of operations (push, swap, rotate).
- Minimize the number of moves to sort the stack.

## My Approach
- **Algorithm**: Implemented the Radix sort method.
- **How**: Used base-2 (binary) to sort numbers by digit, pushing them between stacks A and B.
- **Inspiration**: Used this [repo](https://github.com/LeoFu9487/push_swap_tutorial?source=post_page-----fa746e6aba1e---------------------------------------) by LeoFu9487 for helping me understand radix.


## Usage
```bash
./push_swap 3 1 4 2 or ./push_swap "3 1 4 2"
```
